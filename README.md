# diabetes_prediction
In this project, five different machine learning (ML) models are trained and compared in term of predicting the early-stage diabetes. A data collected in hospital Frankfurt, Germany containing 2000 patients’ information have been used in this study. RF, NB, SVM, KNN, and LR are the five models used for predicting the diabetes.
